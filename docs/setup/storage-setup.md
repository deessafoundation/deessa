## 🚀 Setup Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Run SQL Script in Supabase

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Copy the contents of `scripts/db/migrations/003-storage-setup.sql`
5. Paste and click **Run**

This creates:

- 6 storage buckets (project-images, story-images, team-photos, event-images, partner-logos, videos)
- File size limits (5MB for images, 100MB for videos)
- MIME type restrictions (only valid image/video formats)
- Security policies (public read, authenticated write/delete)

### Step 2: Verify Storage Buckets

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage** (left sidebar)
2. You should see 6 new buckets:
   - `project-images`
   - `story-images`
   - `team-photos`
   - `event-images`
   - `partner-logos`
   - `videos`

3. Each bucket should be marked as **Public** ✅

### Step 3: Test the Upload Functionality

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Login to admin panel: `/admin/login`
3. Create a new story/project/event
4. Try uploading an image using the new upload component
5. You should see:
   - Drag & drop upload area
   - Or toggle to "Use URL" for external links
   - Image preview after upload
   - Remove button to clear

## 💰 Storage Costs

### Supabase Free Tier

- **Storage:** 1GB free
- **Bandwidth:** 2GB/month free
- **Perfect for your NGO** - Will stay free for years!

### Estimated Usage

- Each image: ~500KB average
- 1GB = ~2,000 images
- Your current needs: ~100-200 images
- **Usage:** ~5-10% of free tier ✅

### After Free Tier

- Storage: $0.021/GB/month
- Bandwidth: $0.09/GB
- Example: 2GB storage + 5GB bandwidth = ~$0.50/month

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Upload failed" error

**Solution:** Make sure you ran the SQL script to create storage buckets

### Issue: "You must be logged in" error

**Solution:** Check that you're logged into the admin panel with valid credentials

### Issue: "File size too large" error

**Solution:** Images must be under 5MB. Compress before uploading or use external URL

### Issue: Image not displaying after upload

**Solution:** Check that storage bucket is marked as "Public" in Supabase dashboard

### Issue: Can't delete uploaded files

**Solution:** You can only delete files you uploaded (security feature)

## 📝 Code Examples

### Using FileUpload Component

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from "@/components/admin/file-upload"

const [imageUrl, setImageUrl] = useState("")

<FileUpload
  bucket="story-images"
  currentUrl={imageUrl}
  onUpload={setImageUrl}
  label="Story Image"
  maxSizeMB={5}
  allowUrl={true}
/>

<input type="hidden" name="image" value={imageUrl} />
```

### Props

- `bucket` - Which storage bucket to use
- `currentUrl` - Existing image URL (for editing)
- `onUpload` - Callback when upload completes
- `label` - Display label
- `maxSizeMB` - File size limit
- `allowUrl` - Show URL input toggle

## 🎉 What's Preserved

All existing functionality remains intact:

- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Submit/cancel buttons
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ External URL support (backward compatible)
- ✅ All other form fields
- ✅ Create/update operations
- ✅ Navigation after save
- ✅ Role-based permissions

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Run the SQL script FIRST** - Upload won't work without storage buckets
2. **Test in dev environment** - Make sure everything works before production
3. **Existing URLs still work** - Old external URLs are not affected
4. **Files are organized** - Each user's uploads go in their own folder
5. **Public access** - Uploaded files are publicly accessible (needed for display)
