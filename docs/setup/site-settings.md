# Site Settings Enhancement - Setup Guide

## Overview

The admin site settings have been significantly expanded to give you full control over all images and content displayed on your website. You can now configure homepage images, page hero sections, press gallery, and branding assetsâ€”all through the admin panel!

---

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run SQL Scripts in Supabase

You need to run two new SQL scripts in your Supabase dashboard to create the necessary storage buckets and default settings.

#### 1.1 Create Storage Buckets

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Open `scripts/004-site-assets-storage.sql`
5. Copy all contents and paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**

This creates 4 new storage buckets:

- `hero-images` (10MB limit) - For page hero sections
- `site-assets` (5MB limit) - For logos, favicons
- `press-gallery` (10MB limit) - For press media photos
- `og-images` (5MB limit) - For social sharing images

#### 1.2 Add Default Site Settings

1. In the same SQL Editor
2. Open `scripts/005-expand-site-settings.sql`
3. Copy all contents and paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**

This populates the database with default settings for all pages (using your current hardcoded images as defaults).

### Step 2: Verify Storage Buckets

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage** (left sidebar)
2. You should now see 10 total buckets (6 old + 4 new):
   - âœ… project-images
   - âœ… story-images
   - âœ… team-photos
   - âœ… event-images
   - âœ… partner-logos
   - âœ… videos
   - âœ… **hero-images** (NEW)
   - âœ… **site-assets** (NEW)
   - âœ… **press-gallery** (NEW)
   - âœ… **og-images** (NEW)

All should be marked as **Public** âœ…

## ðŸŽ¨ Admin Panel Features

### New Tabs in Site Settings (/admin/settings)

The Site Settings page now has **8 tabs** instead of 4:

1. **General** _(existing)_ - Site name, tagline, description
2. **Contact** _(existing)_ - Email, phone, address, office hours
3. **Social** _(existing)_ - Social media links
4. **SEO** _(existing)_ - Meta tags, keywords
5. **Homepage** _(NEW)_ ðŸ†• - Hero images, initiative cards

## ðŸ”„ Fallback System

**Important:** All pages have been designed with fallback support. This means:

- âœ… If settings aren't configured, pages use the existing hardcoded images
- âœ… If SQL scripts aren't run, nothing breaks
- âœ… Old functionality remains 100% intact
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing features

Pages will automatically use database settings when available, or fall back to defaults.
