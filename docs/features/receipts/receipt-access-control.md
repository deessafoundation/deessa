# Receipt Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 14 - Receipt Access Control from the Payment Architecture V2 specification. The implementation adds secure, token-based authentication to receipt downloads and resend operations.

## Completed Sub-Tasks

### âœ… 14.1 Implement receipt token generation
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation:**
- Created `lib/receipts/token.ts` with JWT-based token generation and verification
- Uses `jose` library with HS256 algorithm for cryptographic signing
- Tokens include donation ID, receipt number, and 30-day expiry
- Provides helper function for generating complete download URLs

**Key Functions:**
- `generateReceiptToken(donationId, receiptNumber, expiryDays)` - Creates signed JWT
- `verifyReceiptToken(token)` - Validates and decodes token
- `generateReceiptDownloadUrl(donationId, receiptNumber, baseUrl)` - Generates full URL with token

**Security Features:**
- Cryptographically signed tokens prevent tampering
- Time-limited expiry (30 days default, configurable)
- Token binding to specific donation ID and receipt number
- Clear error messages for expired or invalid tokens

### âœ… 14.2 Update receipt download endpoint
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation:**
- Modified `app/api/receipts/download/route.ts` to require token authentication
- Added dual-path support: token-based (primary) and legacy receipt number (fallback)
- Verifies token signature and expiry before serving receipt
- Validates donation ID and receipt number match database records

**Security Improvements:**
- Removed unauthenticated sequential receipt number access
- Added token verification with clear error responses
- Prevents enumeration attacks on receipt numbers
- Maintains backward compatibility during migration period

**API Changes:**
- **New (Secure):** `GET /api/receipts/download?token=eyJhbGc...`
- **Legacy (Deprecated):** `GET /api/receipts/download?id=RCP-2024-001` (requires `LEGACY_RECEIPT_ACCESS=true`)

### âœ… 14.3 Add legacy receipt access fallback
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation:**
- Added `LEGACY_RECEIPT_ACCESS` environment variable for migration support
- Created comprehensive migration guide at `docs/RECEIPT_TOKEN_MIGRATION.md`
- Implemented 90-day deprecation timeline with three phases
- Added deprecation warnings to logs when legacy access is used

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 (Days 0-60):** Dual support with both methods working
- **Phase 2 (Days 60-90):** Deprecation warnings and user notifications
- **Phase 3 (Day 90+):** Legacy access disabled, token-only authentication

**Documentation:**
- Environment variable configuration
- Security considerations and best practices
- Monitoring metrics and log examples
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Rollback plan for critical issues

### âœ… 14.4 Update receipt resend endpoint
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation:**
- Modified `app/api/receipts/resend/route.ts` with authentication and rate limiting
- Added dual authentication: session-based (for users) and API key (for automation)
- Implemented rate limiting using existing `lib/rate-limit.ts` utility
- Added email verification to prevent unauthorized resends

**Security Features:**
- **Authentication:** Requires valid session or API key
- **Authorization:** Verifies email matches donation (unless admin)
- **Rate Limiting:** 10 requests/hour for users, 100 requests/hour for admins
- **Audit Trail:** Logs all resend attempts with user/IP information

**API Changes:**
- **Request:** `POST /api/receipts/resend` with `{ receiptNumber, email }` body
- **Headers:** `x-api-key` (optional, for programmatic access)
- **Response:** Includes rate limit remaining count
- **Error Codes:** 401 (unauthorized), 403 (forbidden), 429 (rate limited)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Token Generation:**
   ```typescript
   import { generateReceiptToken } from "@/lib/receipts/token"
   const token = await generateReceiptToken("donation-id", "RCP-2024-001")
   console.log(token) // Should output JWT string
   ```

2. **Token Verification:**
   ```typescript
   import { verifyReceiptToken } from "@/lib/receipts/token"
   const verified = await verifyReceiptToken(token)
   console.log(verified) // Should output { donationId, receiptNumber }
   ```

3. **Download with Token:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://example.com/api/receipts/download?token=eyJhbGc..."
   # Should return PDF file
   ```

4. **Download without Token (should fail):**
   ```bash
   curl "https://example.com/api/receipts/download"
   # Should return 401 Unauthorized
   ```

5. **Resend with Authentication:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/receipts/resend" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
     -d '{"receiptNumber": "RCP-2024-001", "email": "donor@example.com"}'
   # Should return success
   ```

6. **Resend without Authentication (should fail):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/receipts/resend" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"receiptNumber": "RCP-2024-001"}'
   # Should return 401 Unauthorized
   ```

7. **Rate Limiting:**
   ```bash
   # Make 11 requests in quick succession
   for i in {1..11}; do
     curl -X POST "https://example.com/api/receipts/resend" \
       -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
       -d '{"receiptNumber": "RCP-2024-001"}'
   done
   # 11th request should return 429 Too Many Requests
   ```

### Automated Testing

Create test files:
- `lib/receipts/__tests__/token.test.ts` - Unit tests for token generation/verification
- `app/api/receipts/download/__tests__/route.test.ts` - Integration tests for download endpoint

   - Token expiry rate

2. **Legacy Access:**
   - Legacy URL usage count (should decline to zero)
   - Users/IPs still using legacy URLs

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Rate limit hits per day
   - Users hitting rate limits
   - Average requests per user

4. **Security:**
   - Invalid token attempts
   - Unauthorized resend attempts
   - Email mismatch attempts

### Log Examples

**Successful Token Download:**
```
[INFO] Receipt download: token verified for donation abc-123, receipt RCP-2024-001
```

**Legacy Access (Warning):**
```
[WARN] Legacy receipt access used for receipt RCP-2024-001. This method is deprecated.
```

**Rate Limit Hit:**
```
[WARN] Rate limit exceeded for user user-123 on receipt resend
```

**Authentication Failure:**
```
