## Problems This System Solves

### Previous Challenge: Manual Registration Tracking

**Before:** Staff received registrations via email, Google Forms, or phone calls, requiring manual entry into spreadsheets, manual invoice generation, and manual payment verification.

**Now:** All registrations are automatically captured in a central database with payment status tracked in real-time.

### Previous Challenge: Payment Collection Complexity

**Before:** Requiring bank transfers or cash payments, with manual reconciliation against registration lists. International attendees had limited payment options.

**Now:** Automated payment processing through secure gateways. Attendees receive unique payment links. System automatically confirms registrations upon payment verification.

### Previous Challenge: Limited Payment Options

**Before:** Only bank transfers available, creating barriers for international and mobile-banking attendees.

**Now:** Three payment gateways supported:

- **Stripe** - for international credit/debit cards and digital wallets
- **Khalti** - for Nepali mobile banking and cards
- **eSewa** - for Nepali digital wallet users

### Previous Challenge: No Payment Time Limits

**Before:** Registrations held indefinitely, leading to ghost bookings and planning challenges.

**Now:** Configurable expiry windows (default: 24 hours) with automatic expiration of unpaid registrations. Admins can extend deadlines when needed.

### Previous Challenge: Communication Overhead

**Before:** Manual email sending for confirmations, reminders, and instructions.

**Now:** Five automated email types sent at appropriate triggers, with customizable templates maintained by staff without developer assistance.

## Key Safety & Reliability Mechanisms

### Financial Safety

1. **Amount Verification** - System verifies that the amount charged matches the configured registration fee before confirming
2. **Payment Review Queue** - Any payment with amount/currency mismatch is flagged for manual admin review
3. **Idempotency Protection** - Duplicate webhook notifications from payment providers are automatically detected and ignored
4. **Audit Trail** - Every payment attempt, status change, and admin action is recorded with timestamps

### Data Reliability

1. **Dual-Verification** - Payment status verified both through direct gateway check and webhook notification for redundancy
2. **Automatic Expiry** - Hourly automated process expires registrations past their deadline, freeing up spots
3. **Backup Access** - Admin can always manually confirm or override payment status if technical issues occur
4. **Data Export** - Complete registration data exportable as CSV at any time

### Communication Reliability

1. **Non-Blocking Emails** - Email failures never prevent registration from being recorded
2. **Resend Capability** - Admins can resend payment links or custom emails at any time
3. **Email Delivery Monitoring** - System uses enterprise-grade Gmail SMTP with application-specific authentication

### System Availability

1. **Hosted on Vercel** - Enterprise-grade hosting with automatic scaling and 99.9% uptime SLA
2. **Database Redundancy** - Supabase (Postgres) with automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
3. **Graceful Degradation** - If email service is temporarily down, registrations still process successfully

## Supported Payment Systems

| Payment Gateway | Coverage | Currency           | Typical Users                               |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Stripe**      | Global   | USD (configurable) | International attendees, credit/debit cards |
| **Khalti**      | Nepal    | NPR                | Nepali banks, mobile wallets, cards         |
| **eSewa**       | Nepal    | NPR                | Nepali digital wallet users                 |

All three systems are:

- Industry-standard secure payment processors
- PCI-DSS compliant (meets banking security standards)
- Integrated with automatic webhook notifications

## How Admins Control Events

### Without Developer Assistance

Staff can directly modify through the admin panel:

- Conference name, dates, and venue
- Registration deadlines
- Registration fees (can be set to zero for free events)
- Different fees for in-person vs. virtual attendance
- Agenda items and session descriptions
- Email templates with personalization variables
- Google Maps location and directions
- Contact information displayed to attendees
- Expiry window for payments (hours)

### Requiring Developer Support

The following changes require technical configuration:

- Adding new payment gateways beyond Stripe/Khalti/eSewa
- Changing the fundamental registration workflow
- Modifying which data fields are collected from attendees
- Creating new admin dashboard reports
- Adjusting security policies or access controls

### Design Philosophy

The system is designed for **content control** by staff and **technical control** by developers. This separation ensures staff can run events independently while maintaining system security and integrity.

## Registration & Payment Lifecycle

### The Attendee Journey

1. **Discovery** - Attendee visits public conference landing page
2. **Registration** - Completes 4-step form (2-3 minutes)
3. **Payment Notification** - Receives email with payment link and 24-hour deadline
4. **Payment Choice** - Chooses to pay immediately or later
5. **Payment Processing** - Completes payment through chosen gateway
6. **Confirmation** - Receives email confirmation with payment receipt
7. **Event Reminders** - Receives pre-event emails with logistics _(if configured)_

### The Admin Journey

1. **Event Setup** - Configure conference details and pricing in admin settings
2. **Monitoring** - Watch dashboard for registration counts and statuses
3. **Payment Review** - Review any payments flagged for manual verification
4. **Communications** - Send custom emails to specific registrants or segments

## System Maturity & Production Readiness

### Current Status: Production-Ready âœ…

This system is:

- **Live and operational** - Actively handling real registrations and payments
- **Battle-tested** - Payment flows verified across all three gateways
- **Secure** - Following industry-standard security practices
- **Documented** - With complete technical and operational documentation
- **Maintainable** - With clear code structure and admin tools

### Known Limitations (By Design)

- Registrants do not create user accounts (each registration is standalone)
- No automated refund processing (refunds handled through payment provider dashboards)
- No discount code or promotional pricing system
- No built-in waitlist feature for sold-out events
- System designed for one conference at a time (can be adapted for multiple events)

These limitations are **intentional design choices** that simplify the system for DEESSA's core use case. All can be added in future phases if needed.

---

## Data Protection & Compliance

### Data Storage

- All registration data is stored in **Supabase (Frankfurt, EU)** by default for production. The region can be changed to the **US** or other available Supabase regions by updating the deployment configuration (see the `SUPABASE_REGION` environment variable in your hosting settings).
- Database protected by Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Admin access requires authentication
- Public API endpoints validated with dual-key security (registration ID + email)

### Data Retention

- Registration records retained indefinitely for historical record-keeping
- CSV export available for external archival
- Personal data can be manually deleted by admin upon request

### GDPR Considerations

- Consent checkbox included in registration form
- Attendees explicitly opt-in to newsletter communications
- Email and phone numbers not shared with third parties
- Payment card data **never stored** (handled entirely by payment gateways)

### Backup & Recovery

- **Supabase automatic backups** - Daily snapshots with 7-day retention
- **Point-in-time recovery** - Can restore database to any moment in last 7 days
- **On-demand export** - CSV export available from admin panel at any time
- **Email records** - Sent emails logged with timestamps (verification available)
