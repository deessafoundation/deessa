---

## 3. Admin Actions Reference

### 3.1 Quick Actions (Always Available)

#### **Resend Email (ðŸ“§)**

**What it does**: Resends the registration confirmation email to the user

**When to use**:

- User didn't receive original email
- Email went to spam
- User deleted email and needs new copy

**How it works**:

1. Click "Resend Email" button
2. System fetches registration data
3. Regenerates email with current payment link (if unpaid)
4. Sends via Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP
5. Shows success toast notification

**Limitations**:

- Gmail limit: 2000 emails/day
- If original email bounced (invalid address), this will also fail
- Does NOT create new payment session (reuses existing payment link)

---

#### **Copy ID (ðŸ“‹)**

**What it does**: Copies registration UUID to clipboard

**When to use**:

- Need to reference registration in logs
- Sharing with developer for debugging
- Creating support tickets

**How it works**:

1. Click "Copy ID" button
2. UUID copied to clipboard
3. Toast shows "ID copied!"

**Example UUID**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

---

#### **Send Custom Email (âœ‰ï¸)**

**What it does**: Allows free-form email to specific user

**When to use**:

- Need to ask user for additional information
- Explaining why payment failed
- Custom instructions for specific case

**UI Flow**:

1. Click "Custom Email"
2. Modal appears with:
   - To: [email] (pre-filled, read-only)
   - Subject: [text input]
   - Message: [textarea]
3. Click "Send"
4. System sends email immediately
5. Confirmation toast appears

**Best Practices**:

- Keep subject concise (< 50 characters)
- Sign with "deessa Foundation Team"
- Include action items clearly
- Provide contact info for follow-up

---

### 3.2 Admin Actions (Status-Dependent)

#### **Confirm (âœ…)**

**Button appears when**: Status is "Pending" or "Pending Payment"

**What it does**: Manually confirms registration + marks as paid + sends confirmation email

**When to use**:

- User paid via bank transfer (offline) â†’ admin verifies â†’ confirms
- Payment webhook failed but payment verified in gateway dashboard
- Special case: VIP invited guest (no payment needed)

**How it works**:

```sql
UPDATE conference_registrations SET
  status = 'confirmed',
  payment_status = 'paid',
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 'registration-id';
```

**âš ï¸ Warning**: This action is **irreversible** from UI. If done by mistake, must update database directly.

**After confirmation**:

- Status changes to "Confirmed"
- Confirmation email sent automatically
- Expiry timer cleared
- Row highlighted green in list

---

#### **Cancel (âŒ)**

**Button appears when**: Status is NOT "Cancelled"

**What it does**: Marks registration as cancelled (does NOT process refund)

**When to use**:

- User requests cancellation
- Duplicate registration detected
- Fraudulent registration identified
- User no longer attending

**How it works**:

```sql
UPDATE conference_registrations SET
  status = 'cancelled',
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 'registration-id';
```

**âš ï¸ Important**: This does NOT:

- Process refund in payment gateway (must do manually)
- Send cancellation email (optional, use "Custom Email")
- Delete data (row preserved for audit)

**Refund Process** (if payment was made):

1. Admin clicks "Cancel" in system
2. Go to payment gateway dashboard (Stripe/Khalti/eSewa)
3. Find transaction by `payment_id`
4. Issue refund manually
5. Refund processed by gateway (2-10 days)
6. (Optional) Send custom email to user confirming refund

---

#### **Mark as Paid (ðŸ’°)**

**Button appears when**: Payment status is "Unpaid" or "Review"

**What it does**: Overrides payment status to "Paid" + confirms registration

**When to use**:

- **Amount mismatch** (status = "Review"): Verified payment in gateway, amount is correct despite mismatch
- **Webhook delayed**: Payment confirmed in Stripe dashboard but webhook hasn't arrived yet
- **Manual verification**: User sent screenshot, admin verified payment

**How it works**:

1. Admin verifies payment in gateway dashboard
2. Clicks "Mark as Paid"
3. Modal appears: "Are you sure? This cannot be undone."
4. Admin clicks "Confirm"
5. System updates:

   ```sql
   UPDATE conference_registrations SET
     payment_status = 'paid',
     status = 'confirmed',
     updated_at = now()
   WHERE id = 'registration-id';
   ```

6. Confirmation email sent

**âš ï¸ Critical**: Only use after verifying payment in gateway dashboard. Do NOT mark as paid without proof of payment.

---

#### **Extend Expiry +24h (â°)**

**Button appears when**: Status is "Pending Payment" and expiry not yet passed

**What it does**: Adds 24 hours to expiry time

**When to use**:

- User requests more time to pay
- Payment gateway was temporarily down
- User had payment issue but resolved now

**How it works**:

```sql
UPDATE conference_registrations SET
  expires_at = expires_at + interval '24 hours',
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 'registration-id';
```

**Can be used multiple times**: Each click adds another 24 hours

**Limitations**:

- Once expired, this button disappears (status changed to "Expired" by cron)
- If expired, must use "Confirm" instead (which ignores expiry)

---

### 3.3 Admin Notes

**What it is**: Private text field for internal notes (not visible to user)

**When to use**:

- Document phone call with user
- Record why manual action was taken
- Track follow-up needed

**How it works**:

1. Type notes in textarea (bottom of detail page)
2. Click "Save Notes"
3. Notes saved to database:

   ```sql
   UPDATE conference_registrations SET
     admin_notes = 'User called, said payment failed due to card decline. Asked to retry.'
   WHERE id = 'registration-id';
   ```

**Best Practices**:

- Include date/time manually: "2026-02-28 3pm: User called..."
- Include your name: "- Admin Jane"
- Be concise and factual
- Do NOT include sensitive financial info (card numbers, passwords)

### 4.3 Updating Settings

**Process**:

1. Navigate to `/admin/conference/settings`
2. Edit fields as needed
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. System validates input (e.g., end date > start date)
5. Settings saved to `site_settings` table:

   ```sql
   UPDATE site_settings SET
     settings = jsonb_set(settings, '{conference}', '{"name":"...","date":"...",...}'),
     updated_at = now()
   WHERE id = 1;
   ```

6. Success toast appears
7. Changes immediately affect public registration page

**âš ï¸ Important**:

- Settings are **NOT versioned** (changes are immediate)
- If users are mid-registration when you change pricing, they see OLD price (calculated at form load)
- After changing pricing, click around to verify new prices display correctly

### 4.4 Settings Impact

   - Go to admin detail page for registration
   - Click "Mark as Paid"
   - Confirm action
   - System sends confirmation email
   - Inform user: "Done! Confirmation email sent."

1. Check `payment_events` table (if you have database access):

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM payment_events
   WHERE conference_registration_id = 'registration-id';
   ```

2. If payment event exists (payment succeeded):
   - Go to admin detail page
   - Click "Confirm" (overrides expiry)
   - System confirms + sends email
3. If no payment event:
   - Check gateway dashboard for payment
   - If found: Mark as Paid
   - If not found: Ask user to register + pay again

## 6. Troubleshooting for Admins

### 6.1 Issue: "Mark as Paid" Button Not Working

**Symptoms**: Button click does nothing, or shows error

**Possible Causes**:

1. **No internet connection**: Check your network
2. **Session expired**: Reload page, log in again
3. **Database error**: Contact developer

**Solution**:

- Refresh page
- Log out and log in again
- Try different browser
- If persistent: Contact developer

---

### 6.2 Issue: CSV Export Shows No Data

**Symptoms**: Downloaded CSV is empty or has only headers

**Possible Causes**:

1. **No registrations exist**: Check if list shows any rows
2. **Filter too restrictive**: Remove filters (click "All")
3. **Database connection issue**: Rare, check Supabase status

**Solution**:

- Click "All" filter first, then export
- Wait 10 seconds, try again
- If persistent: Contact developer

---

### 6.3 Issue: Settings Not Saving

**Symptoms**: Click "Save" but changes don't persist

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Validation error**: Check for red error messages under fields
2. **Session expired**: Log in again
3. **Database issue**: Server error

**Solution**:

- Check for validation errors (e.g., "Price must be positive number")
- Fix errors, save again
- If no errors shown but still fails: Developer issue

**Common Validation Rules**:

- Conference name: 1-200 characters
- Prices: Must be positive numbers
- Dates: End date must be after start date
- Virtual link: Must be valid URL (https://...)

---

### 6.4 Issue: User Still Shows "Pending Payment" After Admin Confirmed

**Symptoms**: Admin clicked "Confirm" but user says page still shows "Awaiting Payment"

**Cause**: User's browser cached old status

**Solution**:

1. Ask user to **hard refresh** page:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
2. Or ask user to visit: `/conference/success?rid=REGISTRATION_ID&email=EMAIL`
3. If still shows pending: Contact developer (cache issue)

---

### 6.5 Issue: Too Many Registrations, Page Loads Slow

**Symptoms**: Admin list page takes 10+ seconds to load

**Cause**: 500+ registrations loaded at once

**Solution** (Current):

- Use search to narrow results
- Use status filters to show subset

**Solution** (Future Enhancement)\*\*:

- Developer must implement pagination (see [10: Improvements & Risks](10-improvements-risks.md) Section 3.4)
