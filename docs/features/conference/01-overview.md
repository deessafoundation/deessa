## 4. System Characteristics

### 4.1 Architecture Pattern

**Pattern**: Monolithic Next.js application with server-side rendering and API routes

**Rationale**:

- Simplicity - Single deployment unit
- Performance - Co-located frontend and backend
- Developer Experience - Shared types between client and server
- Cost Efficiency - Single hosting bill

**Not a Microservices Architecture Because**:

- Scale requirements don't justify distributed complexity
- Feature domain is cohesive (conference management)
- Team size is small (<5 developers)

### 4.2 Rendering Strategy

| Page Type               | Rendering Mode              | Rationale                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Conference landing page | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | SEO-critical, content changes frequently      |
| Registration form       | Client-Side Rendering (CSR) | Interactive wizard with complex state         |
| Admin pages             | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | Real-time data, no client-side caching needed |
| Payment pages           | Client-Side Rendering (CSR) | External redirects, polling logic             |

### 4.3 Data Access Pattern

**Server Actions** (preferred for mutations):

```typescript
"use server";
export async function registerForConference(data: FormData) {
  // Direct DB access, no API route needed
}
```

**API Routes** (used for):

- Payment initiation (requires external redirects)
- Webhook receivers (called by external services)
- Cron jobs (called by Vercel infrastructure)
- CSV export (direct download response)

**Why Both?**

- Server Actions: Better DX, type safety, no duplicate validation
- API Routes: Required for webhooks, cron, and binary responses

### 4.4 Security Model

| Layer                    | Mechanism                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin Access**         | Supabase Auth session (cookie-based, server-side verified)           |
| **Public API Endpoints** | Dual-key verification (registrationId + email)                       |
| **Database**             | Row-Level Security (RLS) policies + service-role bypass where needed |
| **Payment Webhooks**     | HMAC signature verification (provider-specific)                      |
| **Cron Endpoints**       | Bearer token (`CRON_SECRET`)                                         |

**Note**: Public conference pages are **intentionally unauthenticated** - registrants do not create user accounts. Identity is managed via registration ID + email pairs.

### 4.5 Email Delivery Model

**SMTP Configuration**:

```
Host: smtp.gmail.com
Port: 587 (STARTTLS)
Auth: GOOGLE_EMAIL + GOOGLE_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
```

**Email Types**:

1. Registration Received (always sent)
2. Payment Link (sent if fee > 0)
3. Confirmation (sent on payment verified or admin confirm)
4. Cancellation (sent on admin cancel)
5. Custom Admin Email (sent via admin quick action)

**Failure Handling**:

- Email sends are **non-blocking** (`.catch()` used)
- Email failures are logged to the application logs (server console and Vercel dashboard); no centralized log sink (e.g., ELK) is currently configured
- Monitoring/alerting for email failures is planned but not yet implemented; no integration with PagerDuty, CloudWatch, or Sentry as of February 2026
- When email failures are detected (via logs or admin report), admins should manually resend emails using the dashboard's "Resend" button on the affected registration; no automated notification is sent to admins, so regular log review is recommended
- SLA: Admins are expected to review logs and address email failures within 24 hours during active registration periods

**Rate Limits**:

- Gmail SMTP: 2000 emails/day (Google Workspace limit)
- Sufficient for conferences with <1000 attendees per day

## 5. Data Flow Summary

### 5.1 Registration Flow (High-Level)

```
User visits /conference
    â””â”€â–¶ Fetches conference_settings from DB (SSR)

User submits registration form
    â””â”€â–¶ Calls registerForConference() server action
        â””â”€â–¶ Inserts row in conference_registrations table
        â””â”€â–¶ Sends registration email (non-blocking)
        â””â”€â–¶ Returns { success, paymentRequired, registrationId }

If paymentRequired:
    â””â”€â–¶ Redirects to /payment-options with query params

User clicks "Pay Now"
    â””â”€â–¶ Redirects to /pending-payment

User selects payment provider
    â””â”€â–¶ POST /api/conference/start-payment
        â””â”€â–¶ Calls startConferencePayment() server action
            â””â”€â–¶ Creates Stripe/Khalti/eSewa session
            â””â”€â–¶ Updates registration with provider refs
            â””â”€â–¶ Returns { redirectUrl, formData }
        â””â”€â–¶ Browser redirects to gateway URL

User completes payment at gateway
    â””â”€â–¶ Gateway redirects back to /payment-success

/payment-success page confirms payment
    â””â”€â–¶ Direct verify (POST /api/conference/confirm-stripe-session)
    â””â”€â–¶ Polls status (GET /api/conference/status?rid=...)
        â””â”€â–¶ Returns { status, paymentStatus, ... }

Webhook fires in parallel (production reliability)
    â””â”€â–¶ POST /api/webhooks/stripe (or Khalti webhook)
        â””â”€â–¶ Verifies signature
        â””â”€â–¶ Idempotency check via payment_events table
        â””â”€â–¶ Updates conference_registrations
        â””â”€â–¶ Sends confirmation email
```

### 5.2 Admin Confirmation Flow (High-Level)

```
Admin opens /admin/conference/[id]
    â””â”€â–¶ Fetches registration via getConferenceRegistration(id)
    â””â”€â–¶ Displays full detail + action buttons

Admin clicks "Confirm Registration"
    â””â”€â–¶ Calls confirmConferenceRegistration(id, force=false)
        â””â”€â–¶ Validates current status
        â””â”€â–¶ Updates status = 'confirmed'
        â””â”€â–¶ Sends confirmation email (non-blocking)
        â””â”€â–¶ Revalidates page
```

### 5.3 Expiry Flow (Automated)

```
Vercel Cron triggers hourly
    â””â”€â–¶ GET /api/cron/expire-conference-registrations
        â””â”€â–¶ Validates CRON_SECRET Bearer token
        â””â”€â–¶ Bulk UPDATE:
            conference_registrations
            SET status = 'expired'
            WHERE status IN ('pending_payment', 'pending')
              AND payment_status = 'unpaid'
              AND expires_at < now()
              AND expires_at IS NOT NULL
        â””â”€â–¶ Returns { ok: true, expired: count }
```

## 6. Key Design Decisions

### 6.1 Why Server Actions Over API Routes?

**Decision**: Use Server Actions for most mutations (registration, admin actions, status updates)

**Rationale**:

- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between client and server
- **Less Boilerplate**: No need for separate request parsing, validation, response formatting
- **Better DX**: Direct function calls with TypeScript autocomplete
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms work even if JavaScript fails (not currently used, but possible)

**Exception**: Payment initiation uses API routes because external redirects require traditional HTTP responses

### 6.2 Why Dual-Key (ID + Email) Security?

**Decision**: All public API endpoints require both `registrationId` (UUID) and `email` to access registration data

**Rationale**:

- **No User Accounts**: Registrants don't create accounts, so no session-based auth
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: UUID alone is guessable with enough attempts; email serves as shared secret
- **Time-Based Security**: Payment links expire after configured hours (default: 24)
- **User-Friendly**: Email is something users always know and have in their inbox

**Alternative Considered**: Signed JWT tokens - Rejected as more complex with no significant security gain

### 6.3 Why Three Payment Gateways?

**Decision**: Support Stripe (global), Khalti (Nepal), and eSewa (Nepal) simultaneously

**Rationale**:

- **Geographic Coverage**: Nepal has limited credit card adoption; digital wallets dominate
- **User Preference**: Different users prefer different gateways based on existing accounts
- **Conversion Optimization**: More payment options = higher completion rate
- **Fee Optimization**: Domestic gateways (Khalti/eSewa) have lower fees than international cards

**Complexity Trade-off**: Yes, supporting three gateways adds code complexity, but the ROI in registration conversion justifies it

### 6.4 Why Expiry Window?

**Decision**: Automatically expire registrations after configured hours (default: 24) if payment not completed

**Rationale**:

- **Prevent Ghost Bookings**: Ensures abandoned registrations don't block real attendees
- **Financial Planning**: Admin knows within 24 hours which registrations are real
- **Urgency Creation**: Encourages prompt payment completion
- **Capacity Management**: Frees up slots for waiting attendees

**Alternative Considered**: Manual admin pruning - Rejected as labor-intensive and error-prone

### 6.5 Why Non-Blocking Email Sends?

**Decision**: All email sends use `.catch()` to prevent email failures from crashing registration workflow

**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: SMTP failures are common (rate limits, DNS issues, provider downtime)
- **User Experience**: Attendee shouldn't see error message if email fails but registration succeeded
- **Recoverability**: Admin can manually resend emails via dashboard
- **Priority**: Registration data persistence > email delivery

**Monitoring**: Email failures are logged; production monitoring should alert if failure rate exceeds threshold

## 7. Performance Characteristics

### 7.1 Expected Load Profile

| Metric                       | Typical Conference       | Large Conference  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Total Registrations**      | 100-300                  | 500-1000          |
| **Peak Registration Period** | 2-3 days before deadline | Week before event |
| **Peak Requests/Hour**       | ~50-100                  | ~200-500          |
| **Database Queries/Request** | 2-5                      | 2-5 (same)        |
| **Email Volume**             | 300-900 total            | 1500-3000 total   |

**Bottleneck Analysis**:

- **Not CPU-bound**: Form processing is lightweight
- **Not I/O-bound**: Database queries are simple, indexed
- **Potentially email-bound**: Gmail SMTP has 2000/day limit (adequate for most conferences)

### 7.2 Caching Strategy

| Data                        | Cache Level               | Invalidation                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Conference Settings**     | Server-side (no cache)    | N/A (read on every request)            |
| **Admin Registration List** | None                      | Real-time data shown                   |
| **Public Landing Page**     | Browser cache (5 minutes) | Manual revalidation on settings update |

**Opportunities**:

- Conference settings could be cached in-memory or Redis (rarely change during registration period)
- Admin list could use stale-while-revalidate pattern

**Why Not Aggressive Caching?**:

- Registration data changes frequently (payment status updates)
- Admin needs real-time view for decision-making
- Settings updates should reflect immediately on public page

### 8.1 Current Test Coverage

**As of February 2026:**

- No automated test suite exists
- Testing done manually via:
  - Stripe test mode
  - Khalti sandbox
  - eSewa staging environment
  - Manual admin workflow testing

### 8.2 Recommended Test Pyramid

**Unit Tests** (40% of test suite):

- `resolveRegistrationFee()` logic
- `normaliseModeKey()` utility
- Email template variable replacement
- Amount/currency validation functions

**Integration Tests** (40% of test suite):

- Server action end-to-end flows (mock DB)
- Payment provider session creation (mock APIs)
- Email sending (mock SMTP)
- Admin actions with different permission levels

**End-to-End Tests** (20% of test suite):

- Full registration workflow (Playwright/Cypress)
- Payment flow with test cards
- Admin dashboard operations
- CSV export functionality

### 8.3 Critical Test Scenarios

1. **Registration with free event** (fee = 0)
2. **Registration with payment required** â†’ Pay Now â†’ Stripe success
3. **Registration with payment required** â†’ Pay Later â†’ email sent
4. **Payment amount mismatch** â†’ Review status
5. **Payment expiry** â†’ Cron marks expired
6. **Admin manual confirmation** â†’ Confirmation email sent
7. **Admin cancel** â†’ Cancellation email sent
8. **Webhook duplicate** â†’ Idempotency prevents double-processing

## 9. Monitoring & Observability

> These are recommendations; monitoring is not yet implemented as of February 2026. Metrics, logging, and error tracking are planned for future releases. See Section 10: Improvements & Risks for implementation roadmap.

### 9.1 Recommended Metrics

**Application Metrics**:

- Registration submission rate (per hour)
- Payment success rate (by provider)
- Average time-to-payment (from registration to payment completion)
- Email delivery success rate
- API error rate (by endpoint)

**Infrastructure Metrics**:

- Vercel function execution time (95th percentile)
- Supabase database connection pool utilization
- Email queue depth (if using queue in future)

**Business Metrics**:

- Total confirmed registrations
- Revenue by payment provider
- Registration drop-off by step (form analytics)
- Expiry rate (% of registrations that expire unpaid)

### 9.2 Recommended Logging

**Structured Logging** (JSON format):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-28T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "conference",
  "action": "payment_started",
  "registrationId": "uuid",
  "provider": "stripe",
  "amount": 2500,
  "currency": "NPR"
}
```

**Critical Events to Log**:

- Registration created
- Payment initiated (with provider and amount)
- Payment verified (with source: webhook/direct)
- Payment amount mismatch detected
- Admin action performed (with admin email)
- Email send failure
- Cron job execution (with expired count)

### 9.3 Error Tracking

**Recommended**: Sentry or similar error tracking service

**Key Error Categories**:

- Payment provider API failures
- Database constraint violations
- Email SMTP failures
- Webhook signature verification failures
- Cron authentication failures

## 10. Development Workflow

### 10.1 Local Development Setup

**Prerequisites**:

```bash
# Required
Node.js 18+
pnpm 8+

# Optional but recommended
Docker (for local Supabase instance)
Stripe CLI (for webhook testing)
```

**Environment Variables** (see `09-deployment-operations.md` for complete list):

```env
# Minimum required for local dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
GOOGLE_EMAIL=
GOOGLE_EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

**Start Development Server**:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conference
```

### 10.2 Code Organization Principles

**Directory Structure**:

```
app/
  (public)/conference/          # Public-facing pages
  admin/conference/             # Admin pages
  api/conference/               # Public API routes
  api/admin/conference/         # Admin API routes
  api/cron/                     # Scheduled jobs

components/
  conference/                   # Public UI components
  admin/                        # Admin UI components

lib/
  actions/
    conference-registration.ts  # Core business logic
    conference-settings.ts      # Settings management
  email/
    conference-mailer.ts        # Email send functions
    templates/                  # HTML templates
  types/
    conference.ts               # Shared TypeScript types
```

**Naming Conventions**:

- Server Actions: `verbNoun()` (e.g., `registerForConference()`)
- API Routes: RESTful (`/api/resource/action`)
- Components: PascalCase (`ConferenceRegistrationForm`)
- Types: PascalCase with descriptive suffix (`ConferenceRegistration`, `StartPaymentResult`)

### 10.3 Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy**:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/<name>` - Individual feature branches

**Commit Message Format**:

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description if needed.

Fixes #123
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
