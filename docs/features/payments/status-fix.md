# Payment Status Update Fix

## Problem

After successful Stripe payments, donation status remained "pending" instead of updating to "completed".

## Root Cause

In development/local environments, Stripe webhooks cannot reach the local server to update the donation status automatically. The webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/stripe` only works when deployed with a public URL that Stripe can access.

## Solution

Added a fallback mechanism in the Stripe verification endpoint (`/api/payments/stripe/verify/route.ts`) that:

1. **Checks the Stripe session status** when verifying the payment
2. **Updates the donation status** to "completed" if:
   - The payment session shows as paid/complete
   - The donation is still in "pending" status
   - This happens during verification (success page load)

This ensures donations are marked as completed even in development where webhooks don't work.

## How It Works

### Production Flow (with webhooks)

```bash
1. User completes payment on Stripe
2. Stripe sends webhook â†’ /api/webhooks/stripe
3. Webhook updates donation status to "completed"
4. User redirected to success page
5. Success page verifies and shows "completed" status
```

### Development Flow (without webhooks) - FIXED

```bash
1. User completes payment on Stripe
2. Webhook cannot reach local server (expected)
3. User redirected to success page
4. Success page calls /api/payments/stripe/verify
5. Verify endpoint checks Stripe session
6. âœ… NEW: Verify endpoint updates status to "completed"
7. Success page shows "completed" status
```

## Files Modified

### `/app/api/payments/stripe/verify/route.ts`

Added:

- Service role client creation function (bypasses RLS)
- Payment completion check logic
- Automatic status update during verification
- Proper error handling

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// Check if payment was completed
const isPaymentComplete = 
  session?.payment_status === "paid" || 
  session?.status === "complete" ||
  (mode === "mock" && session?.status === "complete")

if (isPaymentComplete) {
  // Update donation status using service role (bypasses RLS)
  const serviceSupabase = createServiceRoleClient()
  await serviceSupabase
    .from("donations")
    .update({
      payment_status: "completed",
      payment_id: `stripe:${session?.id}`,
    })
    .eq("id", donationId)
}
```

## Testing

### Test in Development

1. Start the dev server: `pnpm run dev`
2. Go to `/donate`
3. Select Stripe payment
4. Enter test amount (e.g., $50)
5. Complete payment (use Stripe test cards)
6. You should be redirected to success page
7. âœ… Status should now show "completed" immediately
8. Check admin dashboard `/admin/donations`
9. âœ… Donation should show as "completed"

### Test Cards (Stripe)

- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Authentication: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

Use any future expiry date, any CVC, any postal code.

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Required for Stripe payments
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Required for webhook verification (production only)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Required for status updates
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://....supabase.co
```

## Webhook Setup (Production)

When deploying to production, set up Stripe webhooks:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `checkout.session.expired`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret
5. Add to `.env`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

## Other Payment Providers

### Khalti âœ…

Already handles status updates correctly in `/api/payments/khalti/verify/route.ts`

### eSewa âœ…

Already handles status updates correctly in `/api/payments/esewa/success/route.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Status still showing as "pending"?

1. **Check console logs:**

   ```bash
   # Look for errors in the terminal where dev server is running
   # Should see: "Failed to update donation status: ..." if there's an issue
   ```

2. **Check Supabase service role key:**

   ```bash
   # In .env file, ensure this is set:
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies:**

   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, verify insert policy exists:
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'donations';
   ```

4. **Manual status update:**

   ```sql
   -- Update specific donation to completed:
   UPDATE donations 
   SET payment_status = 'completed',
       payment_id = 'stripe:cs_test_...'
   WHERE id = 'your-donation-id';
   ```

### How to verify webhook is working (production)?

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Check "Recent deliveries" tab
4. Should see successful (200) responses for events

### Mock mode not working?

Check your `.env` file:

```env
PAYMENT_MODE=mock  # or 'live'
```

- `/app/api/payments/stripe/verify/route.ts` - **MODIFIED** - Added status update
- `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Webhook handler (production)
- `/lib/payments/stripe.ts` - Stripe integration logic
- `/app/(public)/donate/success/success-content.tsx` - Success page display
- `/lib/payments/config.ts` - Payment mode configuration

## Benefits

1. âœ… Works in development without ngrok/tunneling
2. âœ… Doesn't require webhook setup for local testing
3. âœ… Backwards compatible with production webhooks
4. âœ… Prevents "stuck" pending donations
5. âœ… Provides immediate feedback to users

## Notes

- Webhooks are still the primary method in production (more reliable)
- Verification endpoint acts as a fallback for local dev
- Uses service role client to bypass RLS policies
- Only updates status if payment is truly completed
- Idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
