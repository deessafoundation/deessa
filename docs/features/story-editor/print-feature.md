## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Print button doesn't work:**
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

**Layout looks wrong in print preview:**
- Check browser zoom is at 100%
- Try different paper size (A4 vs Letter)
- Update browser to latest version

**Images don't print:**
- Check "Background graphics" setting
- Some browsers hide images by default
- Try "Save as PDF" instead

**Text is cut off:**
- Adjust margins in print settings
- Try landscape orientation for wide content
- Reduce scale to 90% or 80%

**Videos show as blank:**
- This is expected (videos can't be printed)
- Videos are automatically hidden in print view
