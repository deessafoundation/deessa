# Stripe Payment Intent Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation enhances the payment system with comprehensive Stripe reference tracking and donor messaging capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migrations

**File: `scripts/db/migrations/031-enhance-payments-stripe-references.sql`**
- Added 5 new columns to `payments` table:
  - `payment_intent_id` - Primary reference for refunds/disputes
  - `session_id` - Checkout flow tracking
  - `subscription_id` - Recurring payment management
  - `customer_id` - Customer management
  - `invoice_id` - Subscription billing
- Backfilled existing data from `transaction_id` and `raw_payload`
- Created indexes for performance
- Added check constraints for data integrity

**File: `scripts/db/migrations/032-add-provider-and-message-to-donations.sql`**
- Added `provider` column to `donations` table (denormalized for convenience)
- Added `donor_message` column to `donations` table
- Backfilled provider from payments table
- Created indexes

### 2. Payment Adapter Updates

**File: `lib/payments/adapters/StripeAdapter.ts`**
- Updated `verifyCheckoutSession()` to extract all Stripe IDs:
  - Payment Intent ID
  - Session ID
  - Subscription ID
  - Customer ID
- Stores all IDs in metadata for PaymentService

### 3. Payment Service Updates

**File: `lib/payments/core/PaymentService.ts`**
- Updated payment insert to store all Stripe-specific IDs
- Extracts IDs from verification result metadata
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 4. Provider Dashboard Utility

**File: `lib/utils/provider-dashboard.ts`**
- Updated `DonationProviderData` interface to include all Stripe IDs
- Implemented priority-based ID selection:
  1. `payment_intent_id` (preferred - direct link)
  2. `session_id` (fallback - list view)
  3. `payment_id` (legacy support)
- Generates correct Stripe dashboard URLs

### 5. Admin Transaction Detail Page

**File: `app/admin/donations/[id]/page.tsx`**
- Updated query to fetch all Stripe references from payments table
- Added `donor_message` to donations query
- Returns `paymentData` object instead of just `paymentTransactionId`

**File: `app/admin/donations/[id]/transaction-detail-client.tsx`**
- Updated interface to use `paymentData` object
- Updated `handleViewDashboard()` to use all available IDs
- Passes all payment references to components

**File: `app/admin/donations/[id]/components/payment-technical.tsx`**
- Displays all Stripe IDs with copy buttons:
  - Payment Intent ID (primary)
  - Checkout Session ID
  - Subscription ID (if applicable)
  - Customer ID
  - Payment ID (legacy)
  - Verification ID
- Added tooltips explaining each ID's purpose
- Shows "Not Available" for missing IDs

**File: `app/admin/donations/[id]/components/donor-information.tsx`**
- Already had donor message support (no changes needed)
- Displays message in a styled box

### 6. Donation Form Updates

**File: `components/donation-form.tsx`**
- Added `message` field to `donorInfo` state
- Imported `Textarea` component
- Added message textarea field to form
- Passes `donorMessage` to donation action

### 7. Donation Action Updates

**File: `lib/actions/donation.ts`**
- Updated `DonationFormData` type to include `donorMessage`
- Updated donation insert to store `donor_message`

## Benefits

### 1. Direct Stripe Dashboard Links
- Admin can now click directly to payment intent in Stripe
- No more manual searching in Stripe dashboard
- Faster support and reconciliation

### 2. Refund Operations Ready
- Payment intent IDs available for programmatic refunds
- Foundation for future refund feature

### 3. Complete Audit Trail
- All Stripe references stored for debugging
- Can track payment flow from checkout to completion
- Better dispute management

### 4. Donor Communication
- Donors can leave messages during donation
- Admin can see donor motivation/messages
- Better donor relationship management

### 5. Future-Proof Architecture
- Ready for subscription management
- Ready for customer portal
- Ready for advanced reconciliation

## Architecture Decisions

### Separation of Concerns
- **Donations table**: Business entity (donor info, receipts)
- **Payments table**: Technical entity (provider-specific IDs)
- Clean separation allows flexibility and scalability

### Denormalization
- Added `provider` to donations table for convenience
- Avoids joins for common queries
- Acceptable trade-off for performance

### Backward Compatibility
- Kept `payment_id` field for legacy support
- All existing queries continue to work
- No breaking changes

### Priority-Based ID Selection
- Tries payment_intent_id first (best)
- Falls back to session_id (acceptable)
- Falls back to payment_id (legacy)
- Graceful degradation
