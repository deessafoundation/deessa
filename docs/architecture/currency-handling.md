# Currency Handling Documentation

## Overview

This document explains how multi-currency donations are handled in the Deesha Foundation platform, particularly for Stripe (USD) and local payment gateways (NPR).

## Problem Statement

Previously, when donations were made through Stripe in USD (e.g., $250), they were being stored in the database correctly with `currency: "USD"`, but the admin dashboard was displaying them as "Rs 250" (Indian Rupees) because it was hardcoding the currency symbol for all donations.

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive multi-currency system that:

1. **Properly stores currency information** in the database
2. **Displays correct currency symbols** ($ for USD, â‚¨ for NPR, â‚¹ for INR)
3. **Supports multiple currencies** in the admin dashboard
4. **Provides utility functions** for consistent currency formatting across the app

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

**File:** `scripts/db/migrations/008-currency-support.sql`

- Ensures `currency` column exists on the `donations` table
- Sets default currency to 'NPR' for backwards compatibility
- Creates a database view `donation_stats_by_currency` for aggregated statistics
- Adds a PostgreSQL function `get_currency_symbol()` for database-level formatting
- Creates an index on the currency column for better performance

To apply this migration:

```sql
-- Run in your Supabase SQL Editor
\i scripts/db/migrations/008-currency-support.sql
```

### 2. Currency Utility Functions

**File:** `lib/utils/currency.ts`

A comprehensive set of utility functions for currency handling:

- `getCurrencySymbol()` - Get symbol for a currency code
- `formatCurrency()` - Format amount with symbol and options
- `formatCurrencyLocale()` - Format using Intl.NumberFormat
- `parseCurrency()` - Parse currency string to number
- `convertCurrency()` - Mock conversion between currencies
- `formatMultiCurrencyTotal()` - Display multiple currency totals

**Supported Currencies:**

- USD (US Dollar) - $
- NPR (Nepali Rupee) - â‚¨
- INR (Indian Rupee) - â‚¹
- EUR (Euro) - â‚¬
- GBP (British Pound) - Â£

### 3. Admin Dashboard Updates

**File:** `app/admin/donations/page.tsx`

- Updated `getDonationStats()` to aggregate donations by currency
- Modified the "Total Donations" card to show totals for each currency
- Updated the donations table to display amounts with correct currency symbols
- Imported and integrated the `formatCurrency()` utility

**Before:**

```tsx
â‚¹{donation.amount.toLocaleString()}
```

**After:**

```tsx
{formatCurrency(donation.amount, donation.currency, { showCode: true })}
// Displays: $250.00 USD or â‚¨250.00 NPR
```

### 4. Success Page Updates

**File:** `app/(public)/donate/success/success-content.tsx`

- Integrated currency formatting utility
- Removed hardcoded currency symbols
- Now correctly displays the currency based on the donation record

## How It Works

### Donation Flow

1. **User selects payment provider:**
   - Stripe â†’ Currency: USD
   - Khalti â†’ Currency: NPR
   - eSewa â†’ Currency: NPR

2. **Donation record is created:**

   ```typescript
   const currency = provider === "stripe" 
     ? settings.defaultCurrency || "USD" 
     : "NPR"
   
   await supabase.from("donations").insert({
     amount: input.amount,
     currency, // USD or NPR
     // ... other fields
   })
   ```

3. **Display in admin dashboard:**

   ```typescript
   formatCurrency(donation.amount, donation.currency, { showCode: true })
   // Results:
   // Stripe: $250.00 USD
   // Khalti: â‚¨250.00 NPR
   // eSewa: â‚¨250.00 NPR
   ```

### Multi-Currency Totals

The admin dashboard now shows separate totals for each currency:

```bash
Total Donations
$5,250.00 USD
â‚¨125,000.00 NPR
```

This prevents mixing currencies and provides clear visibility into donations by currency.

## Usage Examples

### Format a simple amount

```typescript
import { formatCurrency } from "@/lib/utils/currency"

// With currency code
formatCurrency(250, "USD") // "$250.00"
formatCurrency(250, "NPR") // "â‚¨250.00"

// With options
formatCurrency(250, "USD", { showCode: true }) // "$250.00 USD"
formatCurrency(250.50, "NPR", { decimals: 0 }) // "â‚¨251"
```

### Get currency symbol

```typescript
import { getCurrencySymbol } from "@/lib/utils/currency"

getCurrencySymbol("USD") // "$"
getCurrencySymbol("NPR") // "â‚¨"
getCurrencySymbol("INR") // "â‚¹"
getCurrencySymbol(null) // "â‚¨" (default)
```

### Display multi-currency totals

```typescript
import { formatMultiCurrencyTotal } from "@/lib/utils/currency"

const totals = {
  USD: 5250,
  NPR: 125000
}

formatMultiCurrencyTotal(totals)
// "$5,250.00 USD + â‚¨125,000.00 NPR"

// With conversion display
formatMultiCurrencyTotal(totals, { 
  showConversion: true, 
  baseCurrency: "USD" 
})
// "$5,250.00 USD + â‚¨125,000.00 NPR (â‰ˆ$943.40)"
```

## Testing

### Test Currency Display

1. **Make a Stripe donation in USD:**
   - Go to `/donate`
   - Select Stripe payment method
   - Enter amount (e.g., $250)
   - Complete payment
   - Check admin dashboard shows: `$250.00 USD`

2. **Make a Khalti donation in NPR:**
   - Go to `/donate`
   - Select Khalti payment method
   - Enter amount (e.g., 2500)
   - Complete payment
   - Check admin dashboard shows: `â‚¨2,500.00 NPR`

3. **Check multi-currency totals:**
   - Admin dashboard should show separate totals for USD and NPR
   - Each should have the correct symbol and currency code

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check currency distribution
SELECT currency, COUNT(*), SUM(amount)
FROM donations
WHERE payment_status = 'completed'
GROUP BY currency;

-- Use the stats view
SELECT * FROM donation_stats_by_currency;

-- Test the currency symbol function
SELECT id, amount, currency, get_currency_symbol(currency) as symbol
FROM donations
LIMIT 10;
```

## Migration Path

If you have existing donations without currency information:

1. Run the migration script: `scripts/db/migrations/008-currency-support.sql`
2. All NULL currency values will be set to 'NPR' (default)
3. The admin dashboard will automatically display them correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time currency conversion:**
   - Integrate with exchange rate API (e.g., exchangerate-api.io)
   - Update `convertCurrency()` function to use live rates

2. **Multi-currency reporting:**
   - Add filters to view donations by currency
   - Export reports with currency breakdown
   - Charts showing donation trends by currency

3. **Currency preferences:**
   - Allow donors to see amounts in their preferred currency
   - Store conversion rate at time of donation
   - Display both original and converted amounts

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Old donations showing wrong currency

**Solution:** Run the migration script to set default currency for existing records:

```sql
UPDATE donations SET currency = 'NPR' WHERE currency IS NULL;
```

### Issue: Wrong currency symbol displayed

**Solution:** Check that the currency code in the database matches supported currencies:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT currency FROM donations;
```

### Issue: Totals not showing multiple currencies

**Solution:** Ensure you're using the updated `getDonationStats()` function that groups by currency.
