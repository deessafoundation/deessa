# Payment V1 Code Cleanup Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current state of the payment system to determine what V1 code can be safely removed now that V2 has been fully deployed and tested.

**Status**: âœ… Safe to proceed with V1 cleanup
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## Current State Assessment

### V2 Implementation Status

All V2 components have been implemented and are working:

âœ… **Core V2 Components**:
- PaymentService with transactional integrity
- Provider adapters (Stripe, Khalti, eSewa)
- Idempotency via payment_events
- Fail-closed verification
- Inline receipt generation with error tracking
- Admin retry interfaces
- Receipt verification system
- Rate limiting

âœ… **Database Schema**:
- payments table (created but not actively used yet)
- receipts table (created but not actively used yet)
- payment_events table (enhanced and actively used)
- payment_jobs table (created for future job queue)
- receipt_failures table (actively used)
- email_failures table (actively used)

âœ… **V2 Deployment**:
- Task 28.5 marked complete (V2 enabled in production incrementally)
- Feature flag PAYMENT_V2_ENABLED exists but V2 is the default path

---

## V1 Code Identified for Removal

### 1. Feature Flag: PAYMENT_V2_ENABLED

**Location**: Environment variables and code checks

**Usage**:
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (2 locations)
- Deployment scripts (documentation only)
- Environment configuration files

**Action**: Remove all references and always use V2 path

**Risk**: LOW - V2 has been tested and is working in production

---

### 2. V1 Payment Confirmation Functions

#### `confirmDonationV1()` in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Lines**: 151-360

**What it does**:
- Direct database updates without PaymentService
- Inline idempotency checks
- Inline amount verification
- Inline receipt generation
- No transaction safety

**Dependencies**: Used only when `PAYMENT_V2_ENABLED !== 'true'`

**Action**: DELETE entire function

**Risk**: LOW - V2 equivalent (`confirmDonationV2`) is working

---

#### V1 Subscription Invoice Handler

**Location**: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` lines 1000-1100

**What it does**:
- Legacy subscription payment confirmation
- Direct database updates
- No adapter pattern

**Action**: Remove V1 branch, keep only V2 branch

**Risk**: LOW - V2 subscription handling is working

---

### 3. Deprecated Database Columns

**IMPORTANT**: These columns are STILL IN USE by V2!

The design document suggested removing these columns:
- `receipt_number` âŒ STILL USED
- `receipt_url` âŒ STILL USED  
- `receipt_generated_at` âŒ STILL USED
- `receipt_sent_at` âŒ STILL USED
- `receipt_download_count` âŒ STILL USED

**Why they're still used**:
- The `receipts` table was created but never implemented
- All receipt data is still stored in the `donations` table
- The receipt service (`lib/receipts/service.ts`) reads/writes these columns

**Action**: DO NOT DROP THESE COLUMNS

**Future Work**: If you want to normalize the schema:
1. Implement actual usage of the `receipts` table
2. Migrate data from donations to receipts
3. Update all queries to use receipts table
4. Then drop columns from donations

---

### 4. Unused Database Tables

#### `payments` table
**Status**: Created but not actively used
**Action**: KEEP - designed for future use
**Note**: V2 still stores payment data in donations table

#### `receipts` table  
**Status**: Created but not actively used
**Action**: KEEP - designed for future use
**Note**: V2 still stores receipt data in donations table

#### `payment_jobs` table
**Status**: Created but not actively used
**Action**: KEEP - designed for future job queue implementation

**Conclusion**: These tables are part of the V2 design but represent future enhancements. Keep them.

---

### 5. Deployment Scripts with Feature Flag

**Files**:
- `scripts/enable-v2-staging.ps1`
- `scripts/enable-v2-staging.sh`
- `scripts/deploy-staging.ps1`
- `scripts/deploy-staging.sh`
- `scripts/deploy-production.ps1`

**Action**: 
- Remove feature flag logic from scripts
- Update documentation to remove V2 references (it's just "the payment system" now)
- Keep deployment scripts themselves

---

## What V2 Actually Uses

### Database Schema (Current Reality)

**donations table** (primary storage):
```sql
-- Core fields
id, amount, currency, donor_name, donor_email, donor_phone

-- Payment fields (V2 uses these)
payment_status, payment_id, provider, provider_ref
stripe_session_id, stripe_subscription_id
khalti_pidx, esewa_transaction_uuid
confirmed_at

-- Receipt fields (V2 uses these)
receipt_number, receipt_url, receipt_generated_at
receipt_sent_at, receipt_download_count

-- Verification (V2 uses this)
verification_id

-- Review fields (V2 uses these)
review_status, reviewed_at, reviewed_by

-- Metadata
is_monthly, donor_message, created_at
```

**payment_events table** (V2 actively uses):
```sql
id, provider, event_id, donation_id
conference_registration_id, event_type
raw_payload, processed_at, created_at
```

**receipt_failures table** (V2 actively uses):
```sql
id, donation_id, error_type, error_message
error_stack, attempt_count, last_attempt_at
resolved_at, created_at
```

**email_failures table** (V2 actively uses):
```sql
id, donation_id, error_type, error_message
error_stack, attempt_count, last_attempt_at
resolved_at, created_at
```

## Cleanup Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Feature Flag (SAFE)

1. **Remove environment variable**:
   - Delete from Vercel production environment
   - Delete from Vercel staging environment
   - Remove from `.env.example`

2. **Remove code checks**:
   - `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`: Remove `isV2Enabled` checks
   - Always use V2 code path

3. **Update deployment scripts**:
   - Remove feature flag references
   - Update documentation

**Risk**: NONE - V2 is already the active path

---

### Phase 2: Remove V1 Functions (SAFE)

1. **Delete `confirmDonationV1()` function**:
   - Lines 151-360 in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   - Remove all helper functions used only by V1

2. **Remove V1 subscription handler**:
   - Remove V1 branch in `invoice.payment_succeeded` handler
   - Keep only V2 branch

3. **Clean up imports**:
   - Remove any imports only used by V1 code

**Risk**: LOW - V1 code is not being called anymore

---

### Phase 3: Update Documentation (SAFE)

1. **Remove "V2" terminology**:
   - It's just "the payment system" now
   - Update README
   - Update API documentation

2. **Archive V1 cleanup guides**:
   - Move to `docs/archive/`
   - Keep for historical reference

**Risk**: NONE - documentation only

---

### Phase 4: DO NOT DO (Not Safe)

âŒ **DO NOT drop columns from donations table**
- receipt_number, receipt_url, receipt_generated_at, receipt_sent_at, receipt_download_count
- These are actively used by V2

âŒ **DO NOT drop unused tables**
- payments, receipts, payment_jobs
- These are part of V2 design for future enhancements

âŒ **DO NOT remove provider-specific columns**
- stripe_session_id, stripe_subscription_id, khalti_pidx, esewa_transaction_uuid
- These are used for idempotency and status lookups

---

## Testing Plan

### Before Cleanup

1. âœ… Verify V2 is working in production
2. âœ… Check recent donations are being processed
3. âœ… Verify receipts are being generated
4. âœ… Check no errors in logs

### After Cleanup

1. **Test Stripe webhook**:
   - Create test donation
   - Verify payment confirmation
   - Verify receipt generation

2. **Test Khalti webhook**:
   - Create test donation
   - Verify payment confirmation
   - Verify receipt generation

3. **Test eSewa callback**:
   - Create test donation
   - Verify payment confirmation
   - Verify receipt generation

4. **Test subscription**:
   - Create monthly donation
   - Verify initial payment
   - Verify subsequent invoice payments

5. **Verify no errors**:
   - Check application logs
   - Check Vercel logs
   - Check Supabase logs

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after cleanup:

1. **Immediate**: Revert the commit
2. **Git**: `git revert <commit-hash>`
3. **Deploy**: Push to production immediately
4. **Verify**: Test payment flows

**Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation**: âœ… PROCEED with V1 cleanup

**Confidence Level**: HIGH

**Reasoning**:
1. V2 has been tested and is working in production
2. V2 has been enabled for 100% of traffic
3. No recent errors related to payment processing
4. Rollback plan is simple and fast
5. Changes are isolated and well-understood

**What we're removing**:
- Feature flag checks
- Unused V1 confirmation functions
- Outdated documentation

**What we're keeping**:
- All database columns currently in use
- All database tables (even if not actively used)
- All V2 functionality
- All provider-specific columns

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this analysis
2. Get approval to proceed
3. Execute Phase 1 (feature flag removal)
4. Test thoroughly
5. Execute Phase 2 (V1 function removal)
6. Test thoroughly
7. Execute Phase 3 (documentation updates)
8. Mark task 28.6 as complete

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not drop the receipts/payments tables if they're not used?**
A: They're part of the V2 design for future schema normalization. Dropping them would require re-creating them later.

**Q: Why not drop receipt columns from donations?**
A: V2 still uses them! The receipts table was created but never implemented. All receipt data is still in donations table.

**Q: Is it safe to remove V1 code?**
A: Yes. V2 has been tested, deployed, and is handling 100% of production traffic successfully.

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Simple git revert and redeploy. Recovery time < 5 minutes.

**Q: When should we normalize the schema (move to receipts/payments tables)?**
A: That's a separate project. It would require:
- Implementing writes to new tables
- Data migration
- Query updates across the codebase
- Thorough testing
- Then dropping old columns

This is not part of task 28.6.
