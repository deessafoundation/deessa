# Smoke Test Guide - Payment Architecture V2

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for running smoke tests in the staging environment after deploying Payment Architecture V2.

## Prerequisites

- Staging environment deployed
- Database migrations completed
- Test payment provider credentials configured
- Access to staging environment logs
- Access to Supabase dashboard

## Quick Start

### Automated Tests

```bash
# PowerShell
.\scripts\smoke-tests-staging.ps1 -StagingUrl https://your-staging.vercel.app

# Bash
./scripts/smoke-tests-staging.sh https://your-staging.vercel.app
```

### Manual Tests

Follow the detailed test procedures below for each payment provider.

## Test Procedures

### Test 1: Health Check (Automated)

**Purpose:** Verify application is running and healthy

**Steps:**
1. Run: `curl https://staging-url/api/health`
2. Verify response status: 200
3. Verify response body contains:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "checks": {
       "database": { "status": "pass" },
       "paymentConfig": { "status": "pass" }
     }
   }
   ```

**Expected Result:** âœ… Health check returns healthy status

**Troubleshooting:**
- If 500 error: Check application logs
- If database check fails: Verify Supabase connection
- If payment config fails: Check environment variables

   -- Check payment record
   SELECT * FROM payments WHERE donation_id = '[donation-id]';
   -- Expected: 1 row with Stripe transaction details
   
   -- Check receipt
   SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE donation_id = '[donation-id]';
   -- Expected: 1 row with receipt number
   
   -- Check payment event
   SELECT * FROM payment_events WHERE donation_id = '[donation-id]';

   ```

7. **Verify receipt email**
   - Check test email inbox
   - Verify receipt email received

   time curl -X POST https://staging-url/api/webhooks/stripe \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type":"test"}'
   ```
   - Target: < 2 seconds

2. **Confirmation Latency**
   - Measure time from webhook received to donation confirmed
   - Check logs for timing information
   - Target: < 1 second

3. **Receipt Generation Time**
   - Measure time from confirmation to receipt generated
   - Check logs for timing information
   - Target: < 5 seconds

  -d '{"type":"test"}'
```
- Expected: 401 Unauthorized

#### 9.3: Rate Limiting

## Continuous Monitoring

After smoke tests pass, monitor these metrics for 24-48 hours:

### Key Metrics
- Payment confirmation success rate (target: >99%)
- Receipt generation success rate (target: >98%)
- Email send success rate (target: >95%)
- Webhook response time (target: <2s)
- Error rate (target: <1%)

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Payment confirmation rate (last 24 hours)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'CONFIRMED') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
FROM donations 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Receipt generation rate (last 24 hours)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE receipt_number IS NOT NULL) * 100.0 / 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'CONFIRMED') as receipt_rate
FROM donations 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Stuck donations (pending > 1 hour)
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM donations 
WHERE payment_status = 'PENDING' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Recent failures
SELECT * FROM receipt_failures 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

SELECT * FROM email_failures 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

## Next Steps

After successful smoke tests:

1. âœ… Document test results
2. âœ… Review any issues found
3. âœ… Fix critical issues
4. âœ… Enable V2 with feature flag (Task 28.3)
5. âœ… Monitor for 24-48 hours
6. âœ… Prepare production deployment (Task 28.4)
