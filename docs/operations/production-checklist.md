---

## Deployment Execution (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: Database Migrations

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Backup database before proceeding**

- [ ] **BACKUP PRODUCTION DATABASE**
- [ ] Verify backup completed successfully
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor for production project
- [ ] Execute migration: `020-create-payments-table.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check table created: `SELECT * FROM payments LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Execute migration: `021-create-receipts-table.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check table created: `SELECT * FROM receipts LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Execute migration: `023-enhance-payment-events.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check columns added: `\d payment_events`
- [ ] Execute migration: `024-add-indexes.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check indexes: `\di idx_*`
- [ ] Execute migration: `025-atomic-receipt-number.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Test function: `SELECT get_next_receipt_number();`
- [ ] Execute migration: `026-create-receipt-failures-table.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check table created: `SELECT * FROM receipt_failures LIMIT 1;`
- [ ] Execute migration: `027-create-email-failures-table.sql`
  - [ ] Verify no errors
  - [ ] Check table created: `SELECT * FROM email_failures LIMIT 1;`

**Verification Query:**
```sql
-- Should return 5 tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('payments', 'receipts', 'payment_events', 'receipt_failures', 'email_failures');
```

**If any migration fails:**
- [ ] STOP immediately
- [ ] Do NOT proceed with deployment
- [ ] Review error message
- [ ] Consult with team
- [ ] Consider rollback

### Step 2: Application Deployment

**Time: 15-30 minutes**

- [ ] Run build locally: `npm run build`
  - [ ] Verify no build errors
  - [ ] Check bundle size is reasonable
- [ ] Tag release in git:
  ```bash
  git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Payment Architecture V2 Production Release"
  git push origin v2.0.0
  ```
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel production:
  ```bash
  vercel --prod
  ```
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete
- [ ] Note deployment URL and ID
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors

### Step 3: Worker Deployment

**Time: 1 minute**

- [ ] Confirm using MVP inline processing (no separate worker)
- [ ] Note: Worker deployment not needed for MVP

### Step 4: Initial Verification

**Time: 10-15 minutes**

- [ ] Wait 30 seconds for deployment to propagate
- [ ] Health check: `curl https://production-url/api/health`
  - [ ] Status: `healthy`
  - [ ] Database check: `pass`
  - [ ] Payment config check: `pass`
  - [ ] V2 enabled: `false` (should be disabled initially)
- [ ] Configuration validation: `curl https://production-url/api/config/validate`
  - [ ] No errors returned
- [ ] Check application loads: Open production URL in browser
  - [ ] Homepage loads
  - [ ] No console errors
  - [ ] Donation form accessible
- [ ] Verify existing V1 flow still works:
  - [ ] Create test donation (small amount)
  - [ ] Complete payment
  - [ ] Verify success
  - [ ] Check receipt received

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 2 hours)

### Immediate Checks (First 15 minutes)

- [ ] Monitor error rates in real-time
- [ ] Check webhook processing (should use V1)
- [ ] Verify no spike in errors
- [ ] Check database connections stable
- [ ] Monitor response times

### Continuous Monitoring (First 2 hours)

**Every 15 minutes:**
- [ ] Check error rates
- [ ] Review recent logs
- [ ] Check donation success rate
- [ ] Verify receipts generating
- [ ] Check emails sending

**Metrics to Track:**
- [ ] Total donations processed
- [ ] Payment success rate (target: >99%)
- [ ] Receipt generation rate (target: >98%)
- [ ] Email send rate (target: >95%)
- [ ] Average response time (target: <2s)
- [ ] Error rate (target: <1%)

### Database Checks

```sql
-- Recent donations (last hour)
SELECT payment_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM donations 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY payment_status;

-- Stuck donations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM donations 
WHERE payment_status = 'PENDING' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Expected: 0 or very low

-- Recent failures
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM receipt_failures 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Expected: 0

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_failures 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
-- Expected: 0
```

---

## Rollback Criteria

**Rollback immediately if:**
- [ ] Error rate > 5%
- [ ] Payment success rate < 95%
- [ ] Database errors
- [ ] Critical security issue discovered
- [ ] Webhook processing failures
- [ ] Receipt generation failures > 10%

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. **Application Rollback:**
   ```bash
   vercel rollback [previous-deployment-url]
   ```

2. **Database Rollback (if necessary):**
   - Restore from backup
   - Or execute rollback script (see scripts/db/payments-v2/README.md)

3. **Notify Team:**
   - Announce rollback
   - Document reason
   - Schedule post-mortem
