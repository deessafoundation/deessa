## Daily Operations

### Morning Checklist

**Time:** 9:00 AM daily

1. **Check System Health**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```
   - Verify all checks pass
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify provider API status

2. **Review Overnight Donations**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*), payment_status 
   FROM donations 
   WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
   GROUP BY payment_status;
   ```
   - Verify no unusual patterns
   - Check for stuck donations

3. **Check Error Logs**
   ```bash
   vercel logs --prod --since 24h | grep ERROR
   ```
   - Review any errors
   - Investigate patterns
   - Create tickets if needed

4. **Review Donations in REVIEW Status**
   - Go to `/admin/donations/review`
   - Review any donations requiring manual approval
   - Process within 24 hours

5. **Check Receipt Generation**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM donations 
   WHERE payment_status = 'confirmed' 
   AND receipt_number IS NULL 
   AND confirmed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```
   - Should be 0
   - If > 0, check `receipt_failures` table

6. **Check Email Sending**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM donations 
   WHERE payment_status = 'confirmed' 
   AND receipt_number IS NOT NULL 
   AND receipt_sent_at IS NULL 
   AND confirmed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```
   - Should be 0
   - If > 0, check `email_failures` table

### Evening Checklist

**Time:** 5:00 PM daily

1. **Run Reconciliation**
   - See [Reconciliation Procedure](#reconciliation-procedure)

2. **Review Metrics**
   - Go to `/admin/monitoring`
   - Check success rates
   - Verify no alerts

3. **Check Pending Donations**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, donor_email, amount, created_at 
   FROM donations 
   WHERE payment_status = 'pending' 
   AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at;
   ```
   - Investigate any stuck donations
   - Run reconciliation if needed

---

## Reconciliation Procedure

### Purpose

Reconciliation checks for donations stuck in PENDING status and verifies their actual status with payment providers.

### When to Run

- **Scheduled:** Daily at 5:00 PM
- **On-Demand:** When donations are stuck > 1 hour
- **After Incidents:** After provider outages or system issues

### Procedure

#### 1. Identify Stuck Donations

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  donor_name,
  donor_email,
  amount,
  currency,
  provider,
  provider_ref,
  created_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at))/3600 AS hours_pending
FROM donations 
WHERE payment_status = 'pending' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

#### 2. Run Reconciliation Script

```bash
# Manual reconciliation
npm run reconcile

# Or use API endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/reconcile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

#### 3. Review Results

The script will:
- Query each provider for transaction status
- Update donation status based on provider response
- Generate receipts for newly confirmed donations
- Send emails for newly confirmed donations
- Log all actions

#### 4. Handle Failures

For donations that fail reconciliation:

**Stripe:**
```bash
# Lookup session manually
stripe checkout sessions retrieve cs_test_...
```

**Khalti:**
```bash
curl https://khalti.com/api/v2/epayment/lookup/ \
  -H "Authorization: Key $KHALTI_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pidx":"pidx_value"}'
```

**eSewa:**
```bash
curl https://epay.esewa.com.np/api/epay/transaction/status/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_code":"$ESEWA_MERCHANT_ID","transaction_uuid":"uuid"}'
```

#### 5. Manual Updates (Last Resort)

If provider confirms payment but system won't update:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Update donation status
UPDATE donations 
SET 
  payment_status = 'confirmed',
  confirmed_at = NOW(),
  provider_ref = 'manual_confirmation'
WHERE id = 'donation-uuid';

-- Insert payment record
INSERT INTO payments (
  donation_id,
  provider,
  transaction_id,
  amount,
  currency,
  status,
  verified_at
) VALUES (
  'donation-uuid',
  'stripe',
  'ch_123',
  100.00,
  'USD',
  'paid',
  NOW()
);

-- Insert payment event
INSERT INTO payment_events (
  provider,
  event_id,
  donation_id,
  event_type,
  processed_at
) VALUES (
  'stripe',
  'manual_' || gen_random_uuid(),
  'donation-uuid',
  'manual_reconciliation',
  NOW()
);

COMMIT;
```

Then manually trigger receipt generation:
- Go to `/admin/receipts/failed`
- Find donation
- Click "Retry"

#### 6. Document Actions

Log all manual interventions:
```sql
INSERT INTO admin_actions (
  admin_id,
  action_type,
  donation_id,
  notes,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  'admin-user-id',
  'manual_reconciliation',
  'donation-uuid',
  'Manually confirmed after provider verification',
  NOW()
);
```

## Manual Review Procedure

### Purpose

Review donations that require manual approval due to amount/currency mismatches or verification uncertainties.

### When to Review

- **Daily:** Check `/admin/donations/review` every morning
- **On Alert:** When admin alert email received
- **SLA:** Process within 24 hours

### Procedure

#### 1. Access Review Dashboard

Go to `/admin/donations/review`

#### 2. Review Donation Details

For each donation in REVIEW status, check:
- Donor information (name, email)
- Expected amount and currency
- Actual amount and currency from provider
- Provider transaction ID
- Raw provider payload
- Reason for review

#### 3. Verify with Provider

**Stripe:**
```bash
stripe charges retrieve ch_123
```

**Khalti:**
```bash
curl https://khalti.com/api/v2/epayment/lookup/ \
  -H "Authorization: Key $KHALTI_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pidx":"pidx_value"}'
```

**eSewa:**
```bash
curl https://epay.esewa.com.np/api/epay/transaction/status/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_code":"$ESEWA_MERCHANT_ID","transaction_uuid":"uuid"}'
```

#### 4. Make Decision

**Approve if:**
- Amount difference is due to currency conversion
- Amount difference is minor (< 1%)
- Provider confirms correct amount
- Donor can be contacted for clarification

**Reject if:**
- Amount difference is significant (> 5%)
- Suspected fraud
- Provider shows different transaction
- Cannot verify payment

#### 5. Take Action

**To Approve:**
1. Click "Approve" button
2. Add notes explaining decision
3. System will:
   - Update status to CONFIRMED
   - Generate receipt
   - Send email to donor
   - Log admin action

**To Reject:**
1. Click "Reject" button
2. Add notes explaining decision
3. Select rejection reason
4. System will:
   - Update status to FAILED
   - Send notification to donor
   - Log admin action
   - Optionally initiate refund

#### 6. Contact Donor (if needed)

If clarification needed:

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Donation Verification Required

Dear [Donor Name],

We received your donation of [Amount] [Currency] on [Date].

However, we need to verify some details:
- Expected amount: [Expected]
- Received amount: [Actual]

Please reply to this email to confirm the correct amount.

Thank you for your support!
```

#### 7. Document Decision

All actions are automatically logged, but add detailed notes:
- Reason for approval/rejection
- Provider verification details
- Any donor communication
- Special circumstances
